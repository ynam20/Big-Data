# Big-Data

Assignment 1:
Scraped data from Reddit and compared the number of upvotes/comments on
the Black Mirror (a television show) and news subreddits. Used a covariance 
matrix and PCA to analyze the data. 

Scraped Wikipedia pages of all heroes, villains, and ambiguous characters in 
the Marvel universe. Visualized their popularities (as measured by length of page) 
using histograms. 

Assignment 2: 
Performed cross validation on a Naive Bayesian classifier to predict the probability
that a character was a hero or villain. X training set was comprised of the alliances
a given character belonged to. 

Printed entropy of each split in a decision tree classifier for the aforementioned data. 

Visualized Marvel alliances using networks (Erdos Renyi, Barabasi Albert models) 
in addition to NetworkX Python library. 

Assignment 3:
Performed sentiment analysis
on Marvel characters and graphed the results using histograms for each faction (hero, villain, ambiguous).
Additionally, I created a bag of words matrix, whose corpus consisted of all Marvel characters' Wiki pages.
Performed TF-IDF analysis, printed 10 highest scoring words for each of the 10 most popular heroes and villains. 

Final Project:
Used natural language processing to analyze Donald Trump's tweet patterns. 
Our project was featured on the front page of medium.com's data science section,
which receives over 10 MILLION monthly views.

Kaggle competition:
Used a random forest classifier to predict whether or not a Titanic passenger would live. Features included
age, section of the boat that they stayed in, gender, etc. Converted categorical features into numerical,
engineered our own features (eg: calculating family size by adding # of siblings to # of parents and relationship
status). 
With an accuracy of .799, I finished first in our class consisting of 30 people.
