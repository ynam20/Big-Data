    "> **Ex. 4.3.2**: Implement cross validation. The performance of a classifier is strongly dependent on the amount of data it is trained on. In Ex. 4.3.1 you train it on only half of the data and test it on the other half. If you rerun that code multiple times, with random 50/50 partitions, you are gonna see a lot of uncertainty in performance. Cross validation solves this problem by training on a larger subset of the data and testing on a smaller one, and taking the average performance over K-folds of this process.\n",
    "1. Implement cross validation over $K=10$ folds. For each fold you must record the training and test accuracies. In the end, visualize the distributions of test- and training accuracy as histograms in the same plot. It's important that you comment on the result."
